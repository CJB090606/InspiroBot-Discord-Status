# InspiroBot-Rotating-Custom-Discord-Status
This will change you discord custom status with rotating quotes taken from InspiroBot's Mindfullness mode. I am in no way associated with them, just doing this for practice and to have fun. Read the README file to customize the program to your account, otherwise it won't work.

To make it work for your account, download the zip for the project, open the .py file with python, and input your account details to make it cycle your status! Make sure to check the Two Factor Authentication if you have that active for your account.

Give InspiroBot lots of love!

ATENTION: CURRENTLY NOT WORKING! I'LL PROBABLY FIX IT EVENTUALLY, BUT NO IDEA WHEN.
