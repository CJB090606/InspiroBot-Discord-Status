# InspiroBot-Rotating-Custom-Discord-Status
This will change you discord custom status with rotating quotes taken from InspiroBot's Mindfullness mode. I am in no way associated with them, just doing this for practice and to have fun. Read the README file to customize the program to your account, otherwise it won't work.

To make it work for your account, simply open the .py file in any code/text editor and change the lines with DiscordEmail and DiscordPassword to reflect what your account's associated email is and the password for your account, and then simply run the code! You can also change "frequency" to be how often you want it to change your status in seconds. Lastly, update twoFA to False if you do not have Two Factor Authentication on on your account. Hope you enjoy!
